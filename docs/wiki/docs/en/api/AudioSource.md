# AudioSource

<div class="class-info">
class in <b>Infernux.components.builtin</b>
</div>

**Inherits from:** [BuiltinComponent](Component.md)

## Description

Multi-track audio playback component.

Infernux does not expose Unity's single ``clip`` field. Instead one
AudioSource owns ``track_count`` tracks. Assign each track with
``set_track_clip(index, clip)`` or ``set_track_clip_by_guid(index, guid)``,
then call ``play(index)``. ``play_on_awake`` only auto-plays track 0.

For transient SFX, prefer ``play_one_shot(clip, volume_scale)`` rather than
creating temporary AudioSource objects. Set ``spatial_blend`` to 0 for
channel-preserving 2D audio and to 1 for a point-source 3D signal.

<!-- USER CONTENT START --> description
**Status:** Preview · **Verified with:** 0.4.0

AudioSource owns 1–16 tracks; `play_on_awake` starts only track 0. Use pooled one-shots for transient effects and keep assigned AudioClip objects loaded while playback may use them.

## Public Methods

| Method | Description |
|------|------|
| `set_track_clip(track_index: int, clip: Any) → None` | Assign an AudioClip wrapper or native clip to a zero-based track. |
| `get_track_clip(track_index: int) → Any` | Return the audio clip assigned to the specified track. |
| `get_track_clip_guid(track_index: int) → str` | Return the asset GUID of the clip on the specified track. |
| `set_track_clip_by_guid(track_index: int, guid: str) → None` | Assign an audio clip to a track by asset GUID. |
| `set_track_volume(track_index: int, volume: float) → None` | Set the volume of the specified track. |
| `get_track_volume(track_index: int) → float` | Return the volume of the specified track. |
| `get_track_time(track_index: int = 0) → float` | Clip seconds of the next mixed sample; output buffering can lag. |
| `set_track_time(track_index: int, seconds: float) → None` | Seek within the loaded clip, preserving playing/paused state. |
| `play(track_index: int = ...) → None` | Start playback on the specified zero-based track. |
| `stop(track_index: int = ...) → None` | Stop playback on the specified zero-based track. |
| `play_one_shot(clip: Any, volume_scale: float = ...) → None` | Play a transient clip using the source's pooled one-shot voices. |
| `stop_one_shots() → None` | Stop all currently playing one-shot sounds. |
| `pause(track_index: int = ...) → None` | Pause playback on the specified track. |
| `un_pause(track_index: int = ...) → None` | Resume playback on the specified track. |
| `stop_all() → None` | Stop playback on all tracks and pooled one-shot voices. |
| `is_track_playing(track_index: int) → bool` | Return whether the specified track is currently playing. |
| `is_track_paused(track_index: int) → bool` | Return whether the specified track is currently paused. |
| `is_track_virtual(track_index: int = 0) → bool` | Playback advances without occupying a physical mixing voice. |
| `serialize() → str` | Serialize the component to a JSON string. |
| `deserialize(json_str: str) → bool` | Deserialize the component from a JSON string. |

if audio_object is not None and clip is not None:

    if source is not None:
        source.set_track_clip(0, clip)
        source.loop = True
        source.play(0)

"""Shared publication barrier for standalone Player builds.

Every build entry point must hand :class:`GameBuilder` an immutable snapshot
of an AssetIndex produced *after* editor document writes have reached disk.
The docked Build Settings UI has an incremental variant of this barrier; this
module provides the synchronous form used by automation and headless hosts.

"""Built-in tiled Forward+ rendering pipeline.

Forward and Forward+ intentionally share the same topology and user-facing
effect mount points.  The only semantic difference is the material pass used
for opaque and transparent geometry: this class selects the tiled-light
Forward+ variants while :class:`DefaultForwardPipeline` remains the lightweight
default for ordinary scenes.

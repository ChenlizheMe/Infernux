# Repository automation

All repository-level maintenance entry points live under `scripts/`. Product
runtime code stays in `cpp/` and `python/`; Hub application code stays in
`packaging/`; website-specific generators and contract tests stay in
`docs/tools/`.

| Directory | Purpose | Primary entry point |
|:----------|:--------|:--------------------|
| `acceptance/` | Reusable project-level runtime acceptance, cross-host trajectory comparison, and release evidence manifests | `headless_project_smoke.py` / `compare_headless_trajectories.py` / `build_evidence_manifest.py` |
| `build/` | Build wrappers needed by a specific host toolchain | `cmake_build.py` |
| `docs/` | Maintainer entry points that orchestrate documentation tools | `update_api_docs.bat` |
| `maintenance/` | Safe local workspace housekeeping | `clean_workspace.ps1` |
| `release/` | Local Hub, installer, and wheel builds; official publication runs in GitHub Actions | `release_hub.bat` |
| `setup/` | Clone bootstrap and the supported Python 3.13 Conda environment | `configure_development.ps1` / `configure_development.sh` |

Run every command from the repository root. The entry points resolve the root
from their own location, so they also work when invoked by an absolute path.

Generated files follow the repository output policy:

- `out/` is disposable build, packaging, test, and diagnostic output.
- `dist/releases/<version>/` contains final local release artifacts.
- `dev/` contains private planning and publication drafts and is never cleaned.

Website tool names under `docs/tools/` are intentionally verb-based:
`build-*` creates deterministic artifacts, `check-*` enforces a contract,
`test-*` exercises browser-independent behavior, and `verify-site.mjs` is the
aggregate consistency gate.

For cross-host physics evidence, run `headless_project_smoke.py` with identical
`--fixed-delta`, `--play-frames`, `--track-object`, and `--sample-every`
arguments on each host. Save each result with `--trajectory-output`, then pass
the two JSON files to `compare_headless_trajectories.py`. The comparison ignores
host-specific project paths and checks the sampled state with an explicit
numeric tolerance.

Browser acceptance dependencies are isolated under `scripts/acceptance/`.
Run `npm ci --prefix scripts/acceptance` after cloning, then invoke
`web_mobile_input_smoke.cjs` against a locally served Web Player. On Windows it
uses the installed Microsoft Edge binary; CI hosts may install the pinned
Playwright Chromium build explicitly.

`acceptance/build_player.py` is the non-interactive Player build entry point for
local acceptance and managed CI. It resolves Android and Web exporters from the
source checkout, emits the same progress events as the Editor, and writes an
atomic JSON evidence report even when project validation or toolchain diagnosis
fails. Exporter-specific values use repeatable `--option KEY=JSON` arguments.

For example:

```powershell
conda activate infernux
python scripts/acceptance/build_player.py C:\Projects\Balance android-arm64 C:\Builds\Balance `
  --option android_artifact='"apk"' `
  --option android_python_prefix='"E:\toolchains\infernux-python-3.13.15-android\arm64-v8a"'
```

Release-candidate artifacts and JSON smoke results can be bound to one source
commit with `build_evidence_manifest.py`. Every `--artifact` and `--result`
uses `ID=PATH`; paths must live below `--root`, directory hashes are stable over
sorted relative file names, and `--require-clean` rejects an uncommitted source
tree. The manifest timestamp comes from the source commit rather than wall-clock
time so the same release inputs reproduce the same provenance record.

Android CPython prefixes are accepted only when they carry a complete
`infernux-android-python.json` provenance manifest. After preparing a prefix,
use `setup/android_python_runtime.py stamp` to record its ABI, CPython and
effective minimum Android API levels, NDK version, official source hash,
bundled wheels, and complete payload hash. Use the `verify` command in local or
CI setup before starting an Android build. Prefixes with missing, incompatible,
or modified payloads fail before any Player staging work begins.

On Linux, `setup/build_android_python_runtime.sh` prepares a complete
prefix from pinned CPython and NumPy source archives. It uses CPython's Android
build, cibuildwheel's Android backend, the tracked NumPy cross-file contract,
and an atomic output directory. The command never overwrites an existing
prefix; pass a new output path when rebuilding an ABI.

`setup/build_web_toolchain.sh` prepares the pinned Emscripten SDK, CPython
browser runtime, and Dawn Tint translator used by the Web exporter. It accepts
one cacheable toolchain root, verifies source archives before extraction, keeps
platform code out of the engine package, and records key output hashes in
`infernux-web-toolchain.json`. Install `glslangValidator` separately through the
host package manager because it is a system shader compiler rather than part of
the cached Web toolchain.

Dawn dependency identities are pinned in
`setup/dawn_dependencies.lock.json`. Fifteen dependencies are fetched from the
canonical GitHub repositories named by Dawn's DEPS file. The four
Chromium-vendored dependencies must be prepared on a trusted host from their
official `chromium.googlesource.com` repositories and supplied through
`INFERNUX_DAWN_OFFICIAL_SNAPSHOT_DIR`. That directory must contain one
uncompressed, Git-worktree `.tar` per dependency plus `manifest.json`; the
manifest records `schema: infernux.dawn_official_snapshots`, `version: 1`, the
locked Dawn revision, and for every archive its dependency `path`, filename,
SHA-256, official source URL, commit, and tree. The setup fails before placing
any dependency if any of the four snapshots is missing, unsafe to extract, or
does not match the lock. It never substitutes a community mirror. Invalid
cached repositories are moved into the toolchain root's quarantine directories
rather than deleted.
